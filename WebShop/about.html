    <h2 class="gamevault-info">GameVault is a provider for games that come in form of links, they are original games authorised to be reselled by Steam and Epic Games, the prices here are given at more than half of the price as we believe everybody deserves to play the game that they love whilst at the same time giving the creators some money, the rest of the money comes from Ad Revenues and donations of some very amazing users of the website, misuse of this website would lead to a warrant being issued by INTERPOL and you'll be banned from the website</h2>
